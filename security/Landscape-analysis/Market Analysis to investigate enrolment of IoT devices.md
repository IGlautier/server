The M2M industry is comprised of different segments such as automotive, smart city, building 
automation, smart energy, manufacturing, agriculture, security and safety, health, education etc. 
Although the use cases are quite different, one thing all these areas have in common is that they require not 
only connected devices able to communicate over a variety of network connections, but these 
devices also require remote configuration and control capabilities. For example, M2M devices 
may need to be remotely ‘woken up’, they will require several firmware updates during their 
lifetime, or devices need to be configured for a certain network bearer, or data reporting periods 
and measurement thresholds need be set, or the device’s location has to be provided to a tracking 
centre. It is commonly recognized that the millions of connected devices that make up M2M 
systems and are part of the Internet of Things need to be switched on, configured, provisioned for 
services, maintained, updated with software, possibly switched off and on again, recovered from 
error conditions, monitored, queried for data, repaired, their applications managed and finally the 
devices taken off their network connections at the end of their lifetime. And ideally, all this 
happens remotely.

Wireless Sensor Tags allow monitoring temperature/RH and open/closed status of gate/doors in your home or office, from anywhere with Internet access. Attach them to easy to lose items and locate them through beeping sounds. Data logging, out-of-range and back-in-range notification features come standard on all types of sensor tags.

**Device Enrolment**

1. Install the iPhone/iPad app. Use the 12 digit serial numbers on your Ethernet Tag Manager to create a login. 
2. Associate each new Tag with the Tag Manager <br>  
For water/moisture sensors, please activate by shorting the tip using a metal object (scraping the tip using a coin, for example) or dipping the tip into water. A red light should start flashing on the sensor every few seconds for about 2 minutes, before the sensor goes into sleep again. Search and associate  other tags while the light is flashing.
<br> An unassociated tag periodically broadcasts information about itself when powered on. Tap the "Search an Unassociated Tag" button to receive this information. 
3. When a new tag is found, the information associated with it is displayed. Assign a name to the tag and click "Associate". The new tag name is assigned to the tag and is automatically propagated to all other devices accessing the same tag list.

**Tag Manager Ethernet port specifications**

10Base-T
Requires DHCP server 
Firewall must allow outgoing HTTP (port 80) and port 6667 connection.

The tag is powered by a single CR2032 button cell Lithium battery. The onboard processor is a Microchip PIC16LF720 micro-controller that draws about a fifth of the current than the Amtel ATmega micro-controllers used in the Arduino boards. Wireless operations for the tags is provided by the Microchip MRF 49XA radio, which operates in the sub-GHz MHz ISM bands. While this can be changed, the tags ship and by default operate at 436 MHz. 

**MXD Implications:**

The system is based around an Ethernet Tag Manager which connects directly to the home router and manages all the associated tags. It acts as a bridge between the wireless tags themselves and the Cloud backend which manages the tags.

Setting up the system is a fairly simple procedure. Plug the tag manager into your router and let it grab a DHCP address and announce itself to the mytaglist.com server. The tags included with the tag manager in your shipment should come pre-associated.  If not, pull out the battery tab. If you have a flashing LED that means the tag is unassociated. Go to the web app and click on the button to add a new tag. The tag then shows up in the list on the web backend.

router using the included Ethernet cable.
2. Download and Install the Smart Device Application 
<br> Make sure your smart device is connected to and in range of your wireless router, and then start the application 
on your smart device. When the application starts, it automatically searches for your Gateway through your 
wireless router. If the application finds a Gateway on your local network, it automatically connects to the 
associated lighting network. 
<br>If you want to have access to your lighting kit remotely through the Internet or a mobile data connection, you must first set up an online account. This account will provide authentication for you when you access your lighting kit remotely. You must remain connected locally to your lighting network when you create your account. 
3. Install Light Bulbs on the Network 
<br> The light bulbs in your lighting kit already come pre-connected to the Gateway; however, you must still install the 
light bulbs so that the Gateway can find them on the network. 
<br> To connect lightbulbs to the gateway, follow these steps:
<br> a. When you turn power on, the light bulbs will brighten and dim while attempting to connect wirelessly to your Gateway.
<br> b. Press the sync button on the Gateway once to enable the connection. The activity indicator begins to display a clockwise rotating pattern.
4. Set up Light Bulbs in Application

connected to the Gateway and prompts for set up. 
2. Tap Yes. Your smart device then walks you through setting up each new light bulb.
3. Look for the light bulb that is dimming and fading. This is the light bulb you are currently configuring 
on your smart device. 


**Technical specifications:**

NXPs network software provides the ultra-low-power wireless connectivity for the GreenChip iSSL and GreenChip iCFL modules. JenNet-IP is a 6LoWPAN mesh-under tree network with low memory footprint. The bulbs are IP enabled by a 6LoWPAN stack option used on top of JenNet.
 
The GreenChip smart lighting solution is available in two versions – GreenChip iCFL for compact fluorescents and GreenChip iSSL for LEDs – and currently includes:

1. The GreenChip iCFL or GreenChip iSSL chipsets, which function as highly efficient, dimmable drivers for smart lamps  such as the UBA2027 and the SSL21081.
2. An ultra-low-power standby supply controller with 10mW no-load capability; standby power is particularly critical in smart lighting applications where lamps are continuously “listening” for the command from the user and/or network.
3. A 2.4-GHz IEEE 802.15.4 standard-compatible wireless microcontroller with a Tx/Rx current below 17mA.
4. The hardware components are complemented by NXP’s JenNet-IP software stack, which provides true IP connectivity. Every light bulb has its own IP address, so the system can be controlled by smartphones, tablets, PCs, and other IP-enabled devices.

Other software stacks, including ZigBee, are available as options.

_Lighting Gateway and Remote_

The lighting Gateway is the hub that connects the smart bulbs to your home network. It passes control between your Smart Phone/Tablet and your lamps. The Gateway can do this locally on your Home Network or through a cloud server.

The Lighting Remote control can control four groups of bulbs and can turn the lights on and off, or dim them. The Lighting Remote can be used with or without the gateway.

Handheld remote allows for control of lighting without a gateway or Cloud-service. Adding the Gateway provides powerful Smart Controls and remote access.

**MXD Implications:**

Each light bulb sports a NXP module that wirelessly connects it to the network of bulbs and to a remote control via a JenNet-IP mesh, an ultra-low-power IPv6 wireless network. The heart of the JenNet mesh is the Greenwave wireless controller, which connects to your home network to bridge your WiFi to the lighting WLAN and provide anywhere, anytime access to your lights. 

The NXP solution also includes 128-bit AES encryption.

### 10. ioBridge

ioBridge makes it easy to monitor and control nearly anything via your smart phone or web app using general purpose web gateways. 

_Web Gateways_

ioBridge offers a range of web gateways or modules that connect products and devices to the Internet. Ethernet or Wi-Fi options are available, allowing for plug-and-play configuration and operation. 

_Sensors and Actuators_

These sensors and actuators are typically small circuits that plug directly into one of the web gateway channels. ioBridge classifies its sensors and actuators into two types: Function Boards that use the analog input or digital inputs and outputs, and Smart Boards that extend the functionality of the web gateway.

**Device Enrolment**

1. Connect one of the sensors or actuators to one of a range of available web gateways.
2. Connect the gateway to Ethernet and Power.<br>
The web gateway connects to the internet automatically.
3. Open up your computer's web browser  or smartphone to link to the dashboard and create widgets to monitor and control your device from anywhere.

**Technical specifications**

ioBridge standard web gateways require an Ethernet connection and custom Wi-Fi. Zigbee and other wireless options are also available.

_Network_

Gateways requires a 10/100/1000Base-T auto-negotiated Ethernet connection. Because of the way gateways communicate with the server, no additional ports need to be opened on the firewall or router.

_MAC Filtering_

If the network uses MAC address filtering, the module’s MAC address will need to be added to the router’s “allow” table. The MAC address of the module is configurable via the ioBridge.com Interface.

_IP Addressing_

If the network uses DHCP, the module will request an IP address and obtain an IP automatically by default. If DHCP fails, the module sets itself to an IP address of “169.254.19.77”. By using the telnet menu, the IP Address, Subnet Mask, Gateway, and DNS Addresses are configurable.

**MXD Implications:**

Connecting sensors/actuators to the internet is a matter of plugging in the sensors to the web gateway that is in turn connected to the router and internet at large via Ethernet/Wi-Fi.  

ioBridge Web Gateways are input-output (I/O) routers that act as the interface between local devices and ioBridge’s servers on the internet (ioBridge cloud servers). The ioBridge web-gateway has an Ethernet connection like a home computer that plugs into a local network and creates a connection to ioBridge’s cloud servers.  The ioBridge Web Gateways have I/O channels that enable the control and monitoring of digital inputs, analog inputs, serial data, servos, relays, and digital outputs using web-interfaces provided by ioBridge.
