## Privacy Requirements in the IoT

Privacy is one of the most sensitive subjects in any discussion of IoT protection. The data availability explosion has enabled user tracking and profiling, often carried out without consent. Users have access to an unprecedented number of personalized services, and the IoT environment itself would be able to acquire information about users automatically.

The data collected from IoT devices can reveal information about
the user's habits. For instance, in the power management use case the attacker can learn from basic analysis of the movement sensor data when the user leaves the house, goes to sleep, or wakes up in the morning. In the healthcare system, the signals from the sensors used to report the patients conditions can reveal the medical function of the device, thus reveal private information about the holder.

In the health care scenario, privacy is the main concern for employees when using this technology, since they can be tracked constantly. Also, an attacker can learn about the health condition of patients by standing close and intercepting the signals from the RFID tags that are used to monitor their condition.

As European regulators grapple with the challenges and complexities of formulating a technology-neutral Data Protection Regulation, the difficulties of applying “traditional” concepts such as consent, purpose limitation, transparency, data deletion, accountability and security to the data processing activities carried out by an “Internet-ready” kitchen appliance become readily apparent. 

Using this example, questions around identifying the data controller, obtaining individual consent and adopting a suitable privacy policy become much more challenging. Long-winded privacy notices and consent boxes become obsolete in a world where you have billions of devices generating overwhelming amounts of data. Consumers neither have the time nor inclination to read these things. 

The creation of vast amounts of data that are a consequence of the IoT puts pressure on existing data privacy concepts. For example, data protection laws in the EU are based on the fundamental concept that users should be in control of their personal data. However, as we continue to generate more and more data in our daily lives, there is increasing recognition that not only will we never be in complete control over how our data is used but that our control is actually receding.

Privacy generally seeks to protect information that can be attributed to an individual, and to ensure that the collection, use, retention, disclosure and disposal of personal information is carried out appropriately.

**Personally identifiable data** is any data linked to a person or persistently linked to an IoT device: data that can identify a person via personal information or a device via a unique identifier.  Included are user-entered data, as well as automatically collected data.

**Sensitive information** is personally identifiable data about which users are likely to be concerned, such as precise geo-location; financial and medical information; passwords; stored information such as contacts, photos, and videos; and children’s information.  

###Privacy by design

Privacy by design gives users the tools they need to manage their own data. The solution is not too far from current reality. Whenever users produce a data fragment, they can already use dynamic consent tools that permit certain services to access as little or as much of that data as desired. 

Taking that idea a step further, a user in Central Park could provide a location-based service with the information that he’s in New York City, but not the specific coordinates of the park he is in.

###Transparency and Openness

Transparency is also essential, since users should know which entities are managing their data and how and when those entities are using it. 

* Users should be provided with clear, prominent and timely information regarding the identity and data privacy practices of various entities with access to their data. 
* They should also be aware of the access, collection, sharing and further use of their personal information, including to whom their personal information may be disclosed, enabling them to make informed decisions about whether to use a particular IoT device. 
* A privacy practice shoud be made available to users before the IoT device is enrolled and any data is collected. 

In an Internet of Things world, where providing users with notice and choice often proves extremely difficult, surprise minimization is becoming a powerful tool businesses can use to help engender trust with consumers while avoiding the ire of regulators. In other words, this is about recognizing context, knowing what customers expect from your services and being accountable to them. A successful company should be asking: “Would our users be surprised by what we’re doing with this information?”

Recognizing that the legally required general privacy policy is not always the most effective way to get consumers’ attention, the  ‘surprise minimization’ approach means supplementing the general privacy policy with enhanced measures to alert users and give them control over data practices that are not related to an app’s basic functionality or that involve sensitive information.”

As connected cars, appliances and wearables become more ingrained in our daily lives and consumer-facing interfaces less so, surprise minimization will play an even more powerful role. As an owner of a connected refrigerator, one might expect it to print out a grocery list, but you certainly wouldn’t expect that the software maker shares that data with a health or life insurance firm. A solid business should notify and give people a choice when the data being shared or the person it’s being shared with is outside reasonable expectations.

In another example, Google Maps needs location data to serve its main purpose, but if it also needs access to a mobile device contact list, there should be a provision for notifying and providing the user a choice to opt out of that function. And this is important because it’s readily apparent consumers often face a gap between their expectations and the services provided.

> When you build compliance around explicit consent notices, it’s inevitable that those notices will become longer, all-inclusive, heavily caveated and designed to guard against risk. Consent notices become seen as a legal issue, not a design issue, inhibiting the adoption of Privacy by Design development so that—rather than enhancing user transparency, they have the opposite effect.

> As technology becomes ever more complicated, so it becomes ever more likely that consumers won’t really understand what it is they’re consenting to anyway, no matter how well it’s explained. It’s also a safe bet that users will simply ignore any notice that stands between them and the service they want to receive.

###Notice / Disclosure 

The increasing prevalence of interconnected, smart devices—the Internet of Things—certainly present challenges for how to contextually let users know how they’re being monitored and by whom. 

* There must be a way for an individual to find out what information about him is in a record and how it is used. This should be specified by the device manufacturer/service provider via a notice.

* This notice should be delivered just before collecting the data and gives users an opportunity to allow or prevent the practice.  Another way to achieve the same end is to make readily available from within an app/device both a short privacy statement highlighting potentially unexpected practices, and privacy controls that allow users to make, review, and change their privacy choices.

Probably known as the number-one responsibility for any user of personal information, telling individuals about how their data will be employed in an IoT context throws in a few twists. What kind of privacy notice can a toaster provide? How often will our car remind us that it knows where we are? How politely can a running jacket tell me that I'm just trying too hard??? Privacy professionals will need to be at their most creative to provide any kind of meaningful notice in this new environment. 

But even setting aside the question of how to provide actionable notices, consumers absolutely must be able to find this information somewhere.

###Data Minimisation and Retention

* The collection of personally identifiable data  should be minimised for uses not related to the device’s basic functionality, and the retention of such data should be limited to the period necessary to support the intended function or to meet legal requirements. This data should then subsequently be deleted or rendered anonymous.
* Only the minimum personal information necessary to meet legitimate business purposes and to deliver, provision, maintain or develop applications and services should be collected and otherwise accessed and used.
* The collection of sensitive information must be limited.
* Data that can be used to identify a user or device should not be retained beyond the time period necessary to complete the function for which the data were collected or beyond what was disclosed to the user.
* Procedures for deleting personally identifiable user data that you no longer need must be adopted and continually updated.

Going back to the Smart TV example, having the TV log every time a user changes the channel, may be acceptable, if at all. But having the TV scan all shared files on the home network would definitely fall outside any legitimate need and is a violation of user privacy.

###Informed Choice / Consent

There must be a way for an individual to prevent information about him that was obtained for one purpose from being used or made available for other purposes without his consent.

Intermediaries and platforms should only monitor their customers on affirmative opt-in basis absent a compelling operational necessity. Originally called "Secondary Usage", this principle seeks not only to give an individual a voice as to whether or not PI is shared with others by offering an "opt out," but also is intended to prevent inappropriate use of the data. 

LG Smart TVs, for example, were found to be reporting back to LG every time the user changed the channel. The TVs were also scanning all shared files on the home network and sending a running tally of those back to LG as well. The company allegedly offered an opt-out of “Collection of watching info” in its options menu, but apparently toggling the opt-out didn’t actually do anything.

This, in turn, brings up the question of whether home appliances should be monitoring consumers and reporting everything back to manufacturers by default? This sort of monitoring is particularly invasive. First, it’s comprehensive—it monitors how consumers use all the various services accessed through that intermediary (such as websites, apps or here, TV channels). Second, it’s out of context—you’re trying to connect with other services, not the platform itself.

###Purpose and Use

* The access, collection, sharing, disclosure and further use of users’ personal information shall be limited to meeting legitimate business purposes, such as providing applications or services as requested by users, or to otherwise meet legal obligations.

This ties in well with the data minimisation and retention principle, ensuring that user's information is limited as per business need.

###Respect for User Rights

* Users should be provided with information about, and an easy means to exercise, their rights over the use of their personal information.
* Users should have control over data practices that are not related to an IoT device’s basic functionality or that involve sensitive information.  

 People's ability to access and manipulate their own data is set to grow—and this is not just due to European public policy attempts to strengthen individuals' data protection rights. The IoT presents a great privacy opportunity in this regard. 

###Accountability and Enforcement

* Any IoT device manufacturer or service provider is accountable for complying with applicable laws and with their general privacy policy and any privacy notices that they provide. 
* There is also a pressing need for someone in the organization to be responsible for reviewing the general privacy policy whenever the device is updated or when business practices change. This person should also maintain an archive of previous versions of the policy, maintain rules for limiting internal access to personally identifiable user data, act as the point of contact for privacy questions and comments, and stay informed of new privacy laws and regulations. 

###Access

There must be a way for an individual to correct or amend a record of identifiable information about himself.

Individuals must be able to find out what personal information a company has on file about them, and how they can gain access to it so that data in error can be corrected or removed. 

* Mechanisms must be developed to give users access to the personally identifiable data that the app collects and retains about them.

> There's a general notion in privacy that individuals should have a right to access their information—indeed, this right is hard-coded into EU law. But when so much information is collected—and across so many devices—how can we provide individuals with meaningful access to information in a way that is not totally overwhelming?

### Security 

Personal information must be protected, using reasonable safeguards appropriate to the sensitivity of the information. Any organization creating, maintaining, using, or disseminating records of identifiable personal data must assure the reliability of the data for their intended use and must take precautions to prevent misuse of the data. Generally, PI is categorized, and thus secured, at the highest level, requiring strong authentication, encryption, and stringent controls over physical documents.

Security safeguards must be used to protect personally identifiable data from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, modification, or destruction.

These safeguards should include, but not be limited to, the following:

* Access control of personally identifiable user data on a need-to-know basis.
* Use of encryption in the transit and storage of personally identifiable data.

In relation to IoT data security, it really is a matter of all-hands-on-deck. Technologists will have a massive role to play deploying encryption, tokenisation or any other possible means of pseudo-anonymisation. But much of the burden will fall on service providers who will need to show beyond any reasonable doubt and on an ongoing basis that appropriate measures to protect the data are proactively being applied.

###Data management

A huge issue is deciding who manages the secrets. Technically, cryptographic mechanisms and protocols protect data throughout the service’s life cycle, but some entities might lack the resources to manage such mechanisms.

* There must be policies on how to manage various kinds of data as well as some policy-enforcement mechanism.
* Additionally, these policies must align with legislation on data protection, which itself could change.


> It’s incumbent upon us as privacy professionals to think up a better solution. One that strikes a balance between the legitimate expectations of the individual with regard to his or her privacy and the legitimate interests of the business with regard to its need to collect and use data. One that enables the business to deliver innovative new products and services to consumers in a way that demonstrates respect for their data and engenders their trust and which does not result in lazy, consent-driven compliance. One that encourages controllers to build privacy functionality into their products from the very outset, not address it as an afterthought.
