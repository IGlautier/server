**Goal: Steal a device by gaining physical access**

One way in which a malicious user (either an unauthorised user or an authorised user of the system), could gain access to the system is by physical means. While an authorised user would not typically need to launch any kind of attack to gain physical access to an IoT device, an unauthorised user would need to obtain physical access to the system in order to be able to steal the device.
