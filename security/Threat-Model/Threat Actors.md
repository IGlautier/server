### Authorised user with limited access	

**Motivation for Attack:**

An authorised user of the system may be bribed to perform an attack on the system or he may have an ulterior motive of his own, such as financial gain. A classic example of this would be a home user who manipulates an energy meter to avoid paying a utility bill. 

Such a user may not have access to modify device data if controls have been put into place. This user can launch an attack on the system by using an entry point into the system for further escalation of privilege.

### Authorised user with admin privileges (Super user/root)	

**Motivation for Attack:**

Such a user would have an easy way into the system and would not need to bypass any controls. This user may be bribed, socially engineered or blackmailed into launching an attack on the system or could do it for personal financial gain or out of revenge. 

### Unauthorised user within the system	

**Motivation for Attack:**

An unauthorised user within the system is someone who may have physical access to the network of IoT devices without a legitimate need for it. This attacker can leverage his access to the system to launch an attack or can be bribed/blackmailed/socially engineered into doing so.
  
### Unauthorised user outside the system	

**Motivation for Attack:**

This is a typical attacker with no legitimate access to the network. The motivation for such an attacker would be financial gain, revenge, or to use the attacked system as a launch pad for further attacks of connected systems.
