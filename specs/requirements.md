Requirement:  Lock and wipe of end user device functions should be supported where they may cache sensitive data 

Requirement:  The systems must support administration delegation functions

Requirement:  The systems must support facilities for users to sign up to use the functions of the data store (either as a member of a partner organisation or as an individual), to manage their own profile and preferences in the solution, including saving customised visualisations and functions 

Requirement:  The systems must support managing the terms and conditions of use of the data store/web wrapper and the ability to moderate users' behaviour. 

Requirement:  A user verification process must be in place as part of the registration

Requirement:  The system must provide an ability to manage the functions and preferences of the solution, such as uploading data, data visualisations 

Requirement:  The system must provide an ability to handle configuration and management of metadata 

Requirement:  The system must provide an ability to te ability to remove/suspend data 

Requirement:  The system must provide an ability to manage of historic versions of data sets 

Requirement:  The system must provide an ability to manage data retention periods 

Requirement:  The system must provide an ability to manage data suppression limits

## Networking requirements

Networking requirements define the nature of the physical and logical connection between application and service end points.

Requirement:  Connections from a device to a remote resource, should, as far as possible share physical resources (ie multiplex through the same IP connection)
